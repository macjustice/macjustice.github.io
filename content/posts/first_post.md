After several years of poking at the free site hosting features of GitHub and GitLab, I finally got it together to make this. For anybody curious about how to do it, or how to make their own, I thought I'd start this by documenting how I got this thing built in the first place.

1. Buy a domain
2. Create a GitHub Pages repo
3. "Hello World" index.html
4. Set up DNS and GitHub Pages Custom domain and TLS
5. See the Hello World
6. Hugo 101
